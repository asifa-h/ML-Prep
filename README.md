# ML Prep

This repository documents my structured learning journey toward Machine Learning, with a focus on:

1 - strong fundamentals
2 - clean implementations
3 - experimentation
4 - reflections on results

Each topic is organized into self-contained modules with:
1 - concept explanation
2 - implementation
3 - experiments
4 - takeaways

This repo is intended to show how I think, not just what I know.
